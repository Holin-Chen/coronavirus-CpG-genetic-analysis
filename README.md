# coronavirus-CpG-genetic-analysis
Coronaviruses (CoV) usually exhibit strong CpG deficiency on their genome. This coronavirus pattern of lacking CG dinucleotides can be explained by evasion of the immune response by the zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) in mammalian hosts. This genetic study tried to quantify the magnitude of CpG deficiencies, which can be served as an index of how potentially effective the coronavirus can escape from humanâ€™s immune system, among several coronavirus. They are severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and two bat-derived severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronaviruses (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21).
